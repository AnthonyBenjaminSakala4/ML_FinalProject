# In this notebook, I will attempt at implementing a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based 
# and collaborative filtering) and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system. With us, we have two MovieLens datasets.
# 
# The Full Dataset: Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.
# 
# The Small Dataset: Comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.
# 
# I will build a Simple Recommender using movies from the Full Dataset whereas all personalised recommender systems will make use of the small dataset (due to the computing power I possess being very limited). As a first step, I will build my simple recommender system.

# I use the TMDB Ratings to come up with our Top Movies Chart. I will use IMDB's weighted rating formula to construct my chart. Mathematically, it is represented as follows:
# 
# Weighted Rating (WR) =  (v/v+m.R)+(m/v+m.C) 
# where,
# 
# v is the number of votes for the movie
# m is the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart
# R is the average rating of the movie
# C is the mean vote across the whole report
# The next step is to determine an appropriate value for m. I will use 95th percentile as our cutoff. In other words, for a movie to feature in the charts, it must have more votes than at least 95% of the movies in the list.
# 
# I will build our overall Top 250 Chart and will define a function to build charts for a particular genre. Let's begin!

# Therefore, to qualify to be considered for the chart, a movie has to have at least 434 votes on TMDB.

#build_chart('Romance').head(15)


# The top romance movie according to our metrics is Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

# Content Based Recommender
# 
# The chart we built earlier has some severe limitations. For one, it didn't consider on romantic movies. If a person who loves romantic movies (and hates action) were to look at our Top 15 Chart, s/he wouldn't probably like most of the movies. If s/he were to go one step further and look at our charts by genre, s/he wouldn't still be getting the best recommendations.
# 
# For instance, consider a person who loves Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.
# One inference we can obtain is that what if some people loves such movies. Even if 
# s/he were to access the romance chart, s/he wouldn't find these as the top recommendations.
# 
# To personalise our recommendations more, I am going to build an engine that computes similarity between movies based 
# on certain metrics and suggests movies that are most similar to a particular movie that a user liked. Since we will 
# be using movie metadata (or content) to build this engine, this also known as Content Based Filtering.
# 
# I will build two Content Based Recommenders based on:
# 
# Movie Overviews and Taglines
# Movie Cast, Crew, Keywords and Genre
# Also, as mentioned in the introduction, I will be using a subset of all the movies available to us due to limiting 
# computing power available to me.

# We see that for The Dark Knight, our system is able to identify it as a Batman film and subsequently recommend 
# other Batman films as its top recommendations. But unfortunately, that is all this system can do at the moment. 
# This is not of much use to most people as it doesn't take into considerations very important features such as cast, 
# crew, director and genre, which determine the rating and the popularity of a movie. Someone who liked 
# The Dark Knight probably likes it more because of Nolan and would hate Batman Forever and every other substandard 
# movie in the Batman Franchise.
# 
# Therefore, we are going to use much more suggestive metadata than Overview and Tagline. In the next subsection, 
# we will build a more sophisticated recommender that takes genre, keywords, cast and crew into consideration.

# Metadata Based Recommender
# 
# To build our standard metadata based content recommender, we will need to merge our current dataset with the crew 
# and the keyword datasets. Let us prepare this data as our first step.

# In[28]:

# We now have our cast, crew, genres and credits, all in one dataframe. Let us wrangle this a little more using the 
# following intuitions:
# 
# Crew: From the crew, we will only pick the director as our feature since the others don't contribute that much to 
#     the feel of the movie.
#     
# Cast: Choosing Cast is a little more tricky. Lesser known actors and minor roles do not really affect people's 
#     opinion of a movie. Therefore, we must only select the major characters and their respective actors. 
#     Arbitrarily we will choose the top 3 actors that appear in the credits list.

# My approach to building the recommender is going to be extremely hacky. What I plan on doing is creating a metadata

# create our count matrix as we did in the Description Recommender. The remaining steps are similar to what we did 
# earlier: we calculate the cosine similarities and return movies that are most similar.
# 
# These are steps I will follow in the preparation of my genres and credits data:
# 
# Strip Spaces and Convert to Lowercase from all our features. This way, our engine will not confuse people
# such as Johnny Depp and Johnny Galecki.
# 
# Mention Director 3 times to give it more weight relative to the entire cast.

# Keywords
# 
# I will do a small amount of pre-processing of our keywords before putting them to any use. As a first step, we 
# calculate the frequenct counts of every keyword that appears in the dataset.

# We will reuse the get_recommendations function that we had written earlier. Since our cosine similarity scores

# again and see what recommendations I get this time around.

# In[48]:


#get_recommendations('The Dark Knight').head(10)


# I am much more satisfied with the results I get this time around. The recommendations seem to have recognized other 
# Christopher Nolan movies (due to the high weightage given to director) and put them as top recommendations. 
# 
# We can of course experiment on this engine by trying out different weights for our features 
# (directors, actors, genres), limiting the number of keywords that can be used in the soup, weighing genres based 
# on their frequency, only showing movies with the same languages, etc.

# Let me also get recommendations for another movie, Friday the 13th

#get_recommendations('Friday the 13th').head(10)


# Popularity and Ratings
# 
# One thing that we can notice about our recommendation system is that it recommends movies regardless of ratings and 
# popularity.
# 
# Therefore, we will add a mechanism to remove bad movies and return movies which are popular and have had a good 
# critical response.
# 
# I will take the top 25 movies based on similarity scores and calculate the vote of the 60th percentile movie. Then, 
# using this as the value of  m , we will calculate the weighted rating of each movie using IMDB's formula like we 
# did in the Simple Recommender section.

# Collaborative Filtering
# 
# Our content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.
# 
# Also, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who s/he is.
# 
# Therefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers. Collaborative Filtering is based on the idea that users similar to me can be used to predict how much I will like a particular product or service those users have used/experienced but I have not.
# 
# I will not be implementing Collaborative Filtering from scratch. Instead, I will use the Surprise library that used extremely powerful algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to minimise RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and give great recommendations.
